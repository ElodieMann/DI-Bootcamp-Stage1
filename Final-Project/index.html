          Theodor Herzl was born in the Jewish quarter of Pest, Hungary, to a
          German-speaking, assimilated Jewish family. His father, Jakob Herzl,
          was a successful businessman, and he had an older sister named
          Pauline. The family resided near the Dohány Street Synagogue in
          Budapest. In his youth, Herzl initially aspired to a career in
          sciences but developed a passion for poetry and humanities instead. He
          pursued a career in journalism and also explored playwriting. Herzl
          held a strong admiration for German culture and embraced the concept
          of Bildung, believing that Hungarian Jews could shed their perceived
          "Jewish characteristics" and become civilized Central Europeans. In
          1878, following the death of his sister, the Herzl family relocated to
          Vienna, Austria. At the University of Vienna, Herzl studied law and
          became involved with the German nationalist fraternity Albia, but
          eventually resigned due to their antisemitism. After a brief legal
          career, Herzl focused on journalism and literature. He worked as a
          journalist for a Viennese newspaper and became a correspondent for
          Neue Freie Presse, based in Paris. Herzl also served as the literary
          editor for the same newspaper and wrote several comedies and dramas
          for the Viennese stage. During this period, his writings were more
          descriptive in nature, rather than focusing on Jewish life or
          politics.

          During his time as the Paris correspondent for Neue Freie Presse, Herzl closely followed the Dreyfus affair, a scandalous event that rocked the Third French Republic from 1894 to 1906. This divisive incident involved the false conviction of a Jewish French army captain accused of spying for Germany, accompanied by virulent antisemitism. Herzl witnessed the mass rallies in Paris during and after the Dreyfus trial. The impact of the affair on Herzl's conversion to Zionism has been debated. Some scholars argue that Herzl exaggerated its influence, while others suggest he initially believed in Dreyfus's guilt. However, it was the rise of antisemitic demagogue Karl Lueger in Vienna in 1895 that had a greater effect on Herzl. Herzl's views on Jewish emancipation and assimilation transformed, leading him to advocate for the establishment of a Jewish state. In 1895, he began writing "Der Judenstaat" (The State of the Jews), which argued for Jews to leave Europe and create a nation-state in Palestine. The book gained acclaim, spreading Herzl's ideas and sparking controversy. While receiving support from some Zionist movements, he faced opposition and was criticized for certain writings.

          In 1898, Herzl visited Jerusalem, hoping for recognition of himself
          and Zionism by Emperor Wilhelm II. They had a brief meeting at Mikveh
          Israel and a formal audience in Jerusalem. In 1902-03, Herzl testified
          before the British Royal Commission on Alien Immigration and
          negotiated with the Egyptian government for a settlement in Al 'Arish.
          He also sought support from Pope Pius X, but the Church's policy was
          against it. Following the Kishinev pogrom, Herzl presented proposals
          to improve the Jewish position in Russia. The "Uganda Project," a
          proposal for a Jewish colony in Kenya, faced opposition but was
          ultimately declined in favor of a Jewish homeland in Palestine at the
          7th Zionist Congress in 1905.

          After being diagnosed with a heart issue earlier in the year, Theodor
          Herzl passed away on July 3, 1904, in Edlach, Lower Austria. His cause
          of death was cardiac sclerosis. In his final moments, he expressed his
          love for Palestine and his dedication to his people. Herzl's will
          stated his desire for a simple funeral without speeches or flowers,
          and he requested to be buried next to his father, with the hope that
          one day his remains would be taken to Israel by the Jewish people.
          Despite his wishes, thousands of people attended his funeral, which
          included a eulogy by David Wolffsohn and the recitation of the kaddish
          by Hans Herzl, his son. Initially buried in Vienna, Herzl's remains
          were later transferred to Mount Herzl in Jerusalem in 1949, where he
          was laid to rest. The coffin was draped in a blue and white pall
          featuring a Star of David surrounding a Lion of Judah and seven gold
          stars, symbolizing Herzl's original proposal for the flag of the
          Jewish state.

          Herzl Day (Hebrew: יום הרצל) is an Israeli national holiday celebrated
          annually on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Iyar, to commemorate the
          life and vision of Zionist leader Theodor Herzl
